1. OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent research and recommendations
2. Web search for real-time flight, hotel, and attraction data
3. Real travel data from current sources

Agents:
1. FlightAgent - Flight Specialist (researches real flight options)
2. HotelAgent - Accommodation Specialist (finds real hotels)
3. ItineraryAgent - Travel Planner (creates realistic itineraries)
4. BudgetAgent - Financial Advisor (analyzes real costs)
